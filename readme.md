 # Hello I'm a 4th year Software Systems Engineering student at the University Of Regina with a widely vast knowledge base. Enjoy some of projects
 I am currently in a team that is developing a pet disease detector using ML/AI techniques as our capstone project. 
 FALL 2023
 I indpendently built a fully functioning sentiment analysis reporter. Using multtiple machine leanrinng techniques and models including Logistic Regression, Naive bayes and BERT. HERE 
 - Independetly built an SDG mobile application using React-native with multiple games and activities. HERE
 
 - I built an Elevator controller on a microcontroller using CLI, USART and RTOS(Real- Time Operating system) HERE
 - I create mutliple network level 1 and level 2 simultations using mininet, wireshark, UDP, TCP, TLS,SCP, sockets, threading and many others. EXAMPLE
 SUMMER 2023- Verification and Validation testing for howitzer firing simulator using Java. explanation: github: https://github.com/khavrks/ENSE---_PROJECT/tree/main/src
 
- USING LAMP stack I built a fully functioning web application that lets users subscribe to movies and keep track of subscriptions including features extra features like email verification. All that was built on a physical server which I independently built and maintained for 3 months. QUICK EXPLANATION :  

WINTER 2023- I built a fully functioning obstruction detection rover using C.The rover moved in all directions and could detect upcoming obstructions in both directions and change direction as a result. CHECK HERE
- I built and Implemented multiple solutions using Java, UMLs and software design patterns. Sysytems including ATM simulator, Robot factory simulator, Airline purchasing system and others
